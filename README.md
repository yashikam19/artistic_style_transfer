# Development of an Adaptable Deep Learning Model for Artistic Style Transfer

The aim of this project is to create a deep learning model capable of adapting an existing work to resemble the aesthetic of any art. The model is capable of analyzing the artistic style of the selected art and apply similar stylistic features to a new, original artwork, creating a piece that seems as though it could have been created by the artist themselves.

## Running the notebook
1. Clone the repository. Upload the `art_style_transfer` directory to Google Drive. It contains `art` and `train` directories
2. Upload the `artistic_style_transfer.ipynb` file to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/)
3. Change the runtime to T4 GPU and run all the cells
